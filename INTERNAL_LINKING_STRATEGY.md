# Internal Linking Strategy for Umbrella Broadband

## Overview
This document outlines the internal linking strategy to improve SEO authority distribution and user navigation across the website.

## Content Structure

### Solution Pages (High Authority)
- `/managed-broadband` - Managed Broadband Services
- `/voip` - VoIP Phone Systems
- `/cctv` - CCTV & Security Solutions
- `/access-control` - Access Control Solutions
- `/starlink` - Managed Starlink Services

### Sector Pages (Medium Authority)
- `/sectors` - All sectors overview
  - Student Accommodation
  - Commercial
  - HMO
  - Residential
  - Care Sector
  - Education

### Content Pages (Lower Authority, Link Sources)
- Blog Posts (3 published)
- Case Studies (6 published)

## Linking Strategy

### 1. Blog Posts → Solution Pages
Each blog post should link to 2-3 relevant solution pages within the content.

**Example:**
- "PSTN Switch-Off 2027" → Links to `/voip`
- "UK Leaseholders" → Links to `/managed-broadband`, `/sectors` (HMO)
- "Broadband Reliability" → Links to `/managed-broadband`

### 2. Case Studies → Solution Pages
Each case study should link to the primary solution used in the project.

**Example:**
- "32-bed Serviced Accommodation" → Links to `/managed-broadband`, `/cctv`, `/access-control`
- "40-bed Birmingham Property" → Links to `/managed-broadband`, `/cctv`
- "Jephson Hotel" → Links to `/managed-broadband`, `/voip`

### 3. Related Content Suggestions
- Blog detail pages: Show 2-3 related blog posts
- Case study detail pages: Show 2-3 related case studies
- Solution pages: Link to relevant case studies and blog posts

### 4. Anchor Text Best Practices
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich anchor text
- Avoid generic text like "click here" or "read more"
- Include solution names and benefits in anchor text

**Good Examples:**
- "Learn more about our [Managed Broadband Services](/managed-broadband)"
- "See how we implemented [CCTV & Security Solutions](/cctv)"
- "Explore [VoIP phone systems](/voip) for your business"

**Avoid:**
- "Click here"
- "Read more"
- "Learn more" (without context)
