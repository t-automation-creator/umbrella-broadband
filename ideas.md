  <core_principles>
    1. **Trust & Stability**: Visuals should convey unshakeable reliability.
    2. **Clarity of Information**: Complex tech specs presented simply.
    3. **Global Connectivity**: Imagery suggesting worldwide reach.
    4. **Professional Polish**: High-end corporate finish, no rough edges.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Deep Navy (#0B1C3E) as the foundation representing depth and security, accented with Electric Cyan (#00F0FF) to signify data flow and speed. The combination bridges the gap between traditional corporate stability and modern high-speed tech.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Asymmetric Split-Screen**: Hero sections and feature blocks utilize a 60/40 split, often placing heavy text on the left and expansive, bleeding-edge visuals on the right. This avoids the static feel of centered containers.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Circuit Board Overlays**: Subtle, low-opacity SVG patterns in backgrounds.
    2. **Glass Cards**: Content boxes with slight transparency and backdrop blur.
    3. **Glowing Edges**: Buttons and key images have a faint outer glow.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Precision Feedback**: Hover states are instant and sharp (e.g., borders lighting up). No "mushy" fades; everything feels calibrated and precise.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Data Flow Motion**: Elements slide in from the sides (x-axis) rather than fading up. Lines connect sections as the user scrolls, mimicking data transmission.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Rajdhani* (Bold/SemiBold) – squared-off, technical feel.
    **Body**: *Inter* (Regular) – highly legible, standard tech sans.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Isometric Materialism</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Dimensionality**: Everything has a place in 3D space.
    2. **Tactile Tech**: Interfaces feel like physical control panels.
    3. **Structured Hierarchy**: Strict visual order using elevation (shadows).
    4. **Clean Geometry**: Reliance on perfect shapes and angles.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Monochromatic Blue Slate (#1E293B to #334155) palette. Using shades rather than distinct hues creates a sophisticated, unified look. Contrast is achieved through brightness (white text) rather than color clashes.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Modular Card Grid**: Content is organized into distinct "tiles" or "modules" that interlock. Less whitespace between elements, more defined boundaries.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Isometric Illustrations**: The hero and feature graphics are strictly isometric.
    2. **Deep Shadows**: Elements cast long, soft shadows to establish depth.
    3. **Rounded Squares**: All corners have a consistent, medium radius (approx 12px).
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Lift & Press**: Interactive elements physically "lift" (shadow grows) on hover and "press" (scale down) on click.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Staggered Assembly**: Page elements build themselves piece-by-piece, like a 3D model assembling.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Montserrat* (ExtraBold) – geometric and sturdy.
    **Body**: *Roboto* (Regular) – mechanical but friendly.
  </typography_system>

  <design_movement>Neon Infrastructure</design_movement>
  <core_principles>
    1. **Invisible Power**: Highlighting the infrastructure that powers the world.
    2. **Speed Visualization**: Using light to represent speed.
    3. **Dark Mode Native**: The site is designed dark-first, not just a theme.
    4. **Minimalist Tech**: Stripping away decorative elements to focus on data.
  </core_principles>
  <color_philosophy>
    Void Black (#050505) background with gradients of Teal (#14B8A6) to Violet (#8B5CF6). This represents the "fiber optic" light traveling through the darkness of the infrastructure.
  </color_philosophy>
  <layout_paradigm>
    **Z-Pattern Flow**: Guiding the eye diagonally across the screen from headline to image to next headline, creating a dynamic reading path.
  </layout_paradigm>
  <signature_elements>
    1. **Gradient Text**: Key headlines use a subtle horizontal gradient.
    2. **Thin Line Dividers**: 1px lines separating sections, reminiscent of server racks.
    3. **Dot Matrix Patterns**: Background textures using grid dots.
  </signature_elements>
  <interaction_philosophy>
    **Glow Activation**: Elements don't move, they "energize" (change color/brightness) when interacted with.
  </interaction_philosophy>
  <animation>
    **Pulse & Flicker**: Subtle breathing effects on glowing elements. Text decodes (random characters to final text) on load.
  </animation>
  <typography_system>
    **Headings**: *Space Grotesk* (Bold) – quirky, tech-focused display font.
    **Body**: *DM Sans* (Regular) – geometric, low contrast.
  </typography_system>
